# This script can be used in a GitHub Actions workflow to check for obvious mistakes in the code.
# You can add more checks as needed, such as linting, formatting, etc.
# To use this script in a GitHub Actions workflow, you can create a workflow file like this:   
# .github/workflows/code-review.yml
# name: Code Review
# on: [push, pull_request]
# jobs:
#       - name: Run code review script
#         run: python3.9 Python-Test-1.py
#     steps:
#       - name: Checkout code
#         uses: actions/checkout@v2
#       - name: Run code review script
#         run: python Python-Test-1.py
#       - name: Format code with black
#         run: black Python-Test-1.py
#       - name: Format code with autopep8
#         run: autopep8 --in-place --aggressive Python-Test-1.py
# This workflow will run the script on every push or pull request, checking for obvious mistakes in the code.
# You can extend the script to include more sophisticated checks, such as linting with pylint or flake8,
# or formatting with black or autopep8.
